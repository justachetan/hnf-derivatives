# `models`

- [`tcnn_ingp.py`](tcnn_ingp.py): Instant NGP written using [`tiny-cuda-nn`](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/). The same implementation is also used for the Dense Grid models in the paper. For more details refer to the [documentation of `tiny-cuda-nn`](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md)
- [`triplane.py`](triplane.py): an implementation of the Tri-plane hybrid neural field based on the architecture proposed in [Chan et al.](https://nvlabs.github.io/eg3d/)
